</ol>
<br />
<p className='text-white'><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
<p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
<p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can be used to identify you personally. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication via email) may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>
<br />
<p className='text-white'><strong>Revoking Your Consent to Data Processing</strong></p>
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. An informal email notification to us is sufficient for revoking your consent. The legality of data processing that occurred before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<br />
<p className='text-white'><strong>SSL or TLS Encryption</strong></p>
<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock icon in your browser line.</p>
<p>When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<br />
<p className='text-white'><strong>Information, Blocking, Deletion</strong></p>
<p>Under applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correct, block, or delete this data. For further information on personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address provided in the imprint.</p>
<br />
<p className='text-white'><strong>Objection to Promotional Emails</strong></p>
<p>We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in the context of website legal notice requirements with regard to sending promotional and informational materials not expressly requested. The website operators reserve the right to take legal action in the case of the unsolicited sending of promotional information, for example through spam emails.</p>

<br />
<p className='text-white'><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>This website partially uses cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
<p>Cookies that are required for the performance of electronic communication or to provide certain functions you want (e.g., the shopping cart) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (e.g., cookies for analyzing your browsing behavior) are stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>
<br />
<p className='text-white'><strong>Server Log Files</strong></p>
<p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
  <li>Operating system used</li>
  <li>Referrer URL</li>
  <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
</ul>
<p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, which allows the processing of data for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures.</p>
<br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>Contact Form</strong></p>
<p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your information from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and for any follow-up questions. We do not share this data without your consent.</p>
<p>The processing of the data entered into the contact form is therefore based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time. An informal message to us by email is sufficient for this purpose. The legality of the data processing operations carried out up to the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<p>The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after the completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions, especially retention periods, remain unaffected.</p>
<br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>Storage of IP Address</strong></p>
<p>Our comment function stores the IP addresses of users who write comments. Since we do not check comments on our site before they are activated, we need this data to be able to take action against the author in case of legal violations such as insults or propaganda.</p>
<br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p>
<p>The storage of comments is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke any consent you have given at any time. To do this, an informal notification by email to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

<li class='text-white'><strong>Analysis Tools and Advertising</strong></li>
</ol><br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies." These are text files that are stored on your computer and that enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
<p>The storage of Google Analytics cookies is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
<br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>IP Anonymization</strong></p>
<p>We have activated the IP anonymization function on this website. As a result, your IP address will be truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before it is transmitted to the USA. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.</p>
<br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>Browser Plugin</strong></p>
<p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, please note that in this case, you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>Objection to Data Collection</strong></p>
<p>You can prevent Google Analytics from collecting your data by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie is set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this website: Disable Google Analytics.</p>
<p>For more information on how Google Analytics handles user data, please refer to Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>Contract Data Processing</strong></p>
<p>We have concluded a contract with Google for order data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
<br/>
<p class='text-white'><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Our websites use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in conjunction with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>This function makes it possible to link the advertising target groups created with Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to your previous usage and browsing behavior on one device (e.g., mobile phone) can also be displayed on another of your devices (e.g., tablet or PC).</p>
<p>If you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history to your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be displayed on any device on which you sign in with your Google account.</p>
<p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>
<p>You can permanently object to cross-device targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google account; to do this, follow this link: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>
<p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google account is based solely on your consent, which you can give or withdraw from Google (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). For data collection operations that are not merged into your Google account (for example, because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the merger), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. </p>
